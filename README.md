# Voronoi Diagrams
The plane is split up according to the following rule: check each pixel against an array of seed points, and determine which seed point is nearest. I've initialized the seed points randomly, and assigned random colors to them.

This was a very fun exercise. I'd like to convert it to 3d, to try to improve efficiency, and to compare (or combine) it with Perlin  noise.

A rather pleasing effect can be achieved by setting color according to position on the canvas:

We can also create some brick-like images -- I'm still trying to get the corners to curve:
